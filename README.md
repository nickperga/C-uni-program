In this project, we created a management system for the orders of a pizzeria using threads via pthread library in C. We also used conditions, mutexes and sleeps. 
In the project, we manage the ordering in which we randomly select the number of pizzas the customer wants, and if his order is approved or not.
Also, we manage the cooking and the preparation of the pizzas and their delivery.
